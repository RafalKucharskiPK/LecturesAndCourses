#Exam questions

1. Intro: how does your daily travel plan affect the transport system? Describe your plan and discuss, disaggregate it into the trips. Discuss how do you use the transport system. Do you partially cause traffic jams? Do the traffic jams affect you? 

2. Looking at your bus/tram today morning how would you describe travellers? Where they go to, what is their trip purpose, why did they choose this line? How would it change: a) during school holiday b) if the cars are all broken c) if there are huge traffic jams?

3. Looking at your origin stop in the morning (close to your home) how do you think the situation would change if: a) the new houses are built around for 2 000 people, b) there isn office complex for 2 0000 workers?

4. Discuss how the demand for trips impacts the transport network performance. Discuss on the two cases: - how drivers reduce travel speed in the network. - how the passengers make a congestion in buses/trams.

5. Discuss the within day distribution of Home-Work, Work-Home, Home-School, Work-Shopping trips.

6. What spatial variables impact trip generation (where do people travel from and to)?

7. Discuss most significant trip purposes

8. What are the values in the OD matrices and how they are related to the trip generation (P/A)

9. Imagine there are two options equally interesting, one costs 10zł, another 12zł. What share (from 100 ppl group) will choose the first one which one the second. a) assuming deterministic all or nothing choices, b) assuming probabilistic choices.

10. How does the volume (number of cars) impacts the travel time on an arc and how is it modelled in macroscopic static models?

12. Discuss the traffic assignment on a toy-network, assume deterministic all-or-nothing assigment and equilirium.

13. Discuss purposes of trips in the AM/PM peak.

14. Using figures tell a) for what flow the speed is highest, when the flow starts falling, what spped would we observe for 1000 vehicles, what is the capacity?
